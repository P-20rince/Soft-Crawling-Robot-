# Soft-Crawling-Robot-
In this project we successfully developed a soft crawling robot.
I and my groupmates successfully tackled the most difficult taask i.e. the designing.
We successfully designed a four limb soft robotic crawler. Utiling the CAD Software i.e. Solidworks for the mould designing and printed the mold using 3D printer.    
We researched about the material for its fabrication and found the best match i.e. LSR 110.    
Then we integrated Arduino Uno, relays, air compressor, solenoid valve to provide the motion.    
We programmed the arduino in TinkerCad for simulating the desired motion of the crawler.
